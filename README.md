## 🛰️ My Current Project

<p align="center">
  <img src="./extras/Homelab_PCOS_readme%20banner.png" alt="PCOS Banner" />
</p>

My personal, secure engineering lab collection showcasing ISSO/ISSE/ISSM-related documentation, baselines, and automation. Includes lab architecture, hardware/software baselines, risk documentation, and examples of DoD-aligned systems security engineering practices. With the current initiative being the build-out and completion of all system, network, and associated documentation for self education and DoD Cyber portofolio enrichment.

I attempt to update this repository with updates on my current home lab project initiatives and document updates as a way to bolster my security engineering expertise. Please feel free to explore the code and artifacts I leave here to create, update and document my ongoing adventures in my personal architecture!
