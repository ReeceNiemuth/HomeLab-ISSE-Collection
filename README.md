# 🏠 Home Lab – DoD ISSE 
My personal, secure engineering lab collection showcasing ISSO/ISSE/ISSM-related documentation, baselines, and automation. Includes lab architecture, hardware/software baselines, risk documentation, and examples of DoD-aligned systems security engineering practices.

I attempt to update this repository with updates on my current home lab project initiatives and document updates as a way to bolster my security engineering expertise. Please feel free to explore the code and artifacts I leave here to create, update and document my ongoing adventures in my personal architecture!

## 📂 Repository Structure  

### 📘 System Security Plan (SSP)  
- Lab SSP written in DoD format.  
- System description, boundary definition, security categorizations.  

### 📑 Mock POA&M  
- Sample Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M).  
- Tracks identified risks, remediation timelines, and status.  

### 📊 SCTM (Security Control Traceability Matrix)  
- Modern SCTM (successor to SRTM).  
- Traceability of requirements → security controls → implementation evidence.  

### 🔄 CONMON (Continuous Monitoring)  
- Monitoring strategy and procedures.  
- Integration examples with Splunk and Nessus.  

### ⚙️ SECONOPS (Security Concept of Operations)  
- Overview of operational security posture.  
- Mission objectives, use cases, and concept of employment.  

### 🔧 CM Plan (Configuration Management Plan)  
- Processes for configuration identification, control, status accounting, and audits.  
- Example versioning and change log templates.  

### 🚨 IRP / CP / DRP  
- **Incident Response Plan**  
- **Contingency Plan**  
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**  
- Lab-scale examples with command playbooks and response flow diagrams.  

### ✅ Control Validation  
- Control test plans and validation results.  
- Scripts and methods for validating AC, AU, CM, IA, and SC families.  

### 💻 Hardware Baseline  
- SSP-style hardware baseline tables.  
- Rack nodes, switches, firewalls, UPS, etc.  

### 🖥️ Software Baseline  
- SSP-style software baseline tables.  
- Operating systems, middleware, apps, security tools.  

### 🗺️ Security / Network / Physical Diagrams  
- Visual representations of system boundary, architecture, and data flows.  
- Draw.io/Mermaid diagrams of lab setup.

## 🛡️ Purpose  
This collection mirrors the documentation stack of a real-world ISSO/ISSE environment, enabling me to:  
- Practice **DoD-aligned documentation** in a controlled lab.  
- Develop repeatable templates for system engineering artifacts.  
- Experiment with automation and evidence generation that ties directly to control families.
