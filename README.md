# üè† My Personal Home Lab ‚Äì DoD-Related ISSE Collection
My personal, secure engineering lab collection showcasing ISSO/ISSE/ISSM-related documentation, baselines, and automation. Includes lab architecture, hardware/software baselines, risk documentation, and examples of DoD-aligned systems security engineering practices.

I attempt to update this repository with updates on my current home lab project initiatives and document updates as a way to bolster my security engineering expertise.

Please feel free to explore the code and artifacts I leave here to create, update and document my ongoing adventures in my personal architecture!
